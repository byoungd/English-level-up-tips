# Project

An advanced guide to learn English which might benefit you a lot.

This English version is a work in progress. You can always switch back to the complete Chinese version from the nav above.

## Background

Hi, my friend—welcome.

Back in early July 2017, `W.` (who was preparing for TOEFL) asked me a question:

**How can I learn English efficiently?**

While thinking about an answer, I recalled a semester when I passed 26 courses at once (19 of them were retakes), plus the fact that I once got lucky and ranked No.1 in my province in both `English` and `Chinese` in the college entrance exam (Jiangsu). Maybe I was barely qualified to share a few practical tips.

After talking with her, I realized two things:

- Some people are incredibly passionate about learning.
- Many of us also suffer from ineffective methods, anxiety, and guilt around learning.

This guide is my attempt to organize what I’ve learned and share it with more people.
