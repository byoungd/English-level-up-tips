# Learning with AI (2025 Edition)

Source (中文): [利用 AI 学习](#/threads/part-1/7-ai.md)

In the last few years, large language models (with ChatGPT as the most well-known example) have become genuinely useful tools for learning English.

If you use them well, they can help you:

- build a plan
- generate practice tasks
- correct writing
- give pronunciation feedback (in voice-enabled apps)
- explain grammar
- role-play real conversations for work and daily life

Below are practical ideas and ready-to-copy prompts across “listening / speaking / reading / writing + exams / workplace”.

## 1) Build Your “Personal Language Environment”

Compared to only memorizing words or grinding test questions, AI’s biggest advantage is that it can interact with you anytime—like a patient tutor who never gets tired of your questions.

You can tell it your situation and goal directly, for example:

> I’m an adult learner whose native language is Chinese. My goal is to run work meetings in English comfortably within 6 months.  
> Please ask me a few questions to understand my current level, then create a weekly study plan that includes listening, speaking, reading, and writing practice.  
> Explain the plan in both English and Chinese.

Once you have a plan, you can stay in the same chat and say:

> Today, guide me through Week N, Day X. Keep it around 30 minutes.  
> Lead me step by step, and summarize feedback at the end.

That’s basically a 24/7 learning coach.

## 2) Speaking & Pronunciation: Use AI Like a Patient Tutor

### 2.1 Daily conversation role-play

- Ask AI to play different roles: coworker, client, friend, waiter, interviewer…
- Prompt:

  > Please act as an American coworker. Let’s discuss this week’s project progress in English.  
  > Keep each of your sentences under 15 words. Speak one sentence per turn, wait for my reply, then continue.  
  > After each of my replies, point out 1–2 expressions I can improve.

### 2.2 Pronunciation feedback (voice-enabled apps)

- Read an article out loud or answer questions with your voice. Ask for clear feedback.
- Prompt:

  > I will answer using voice. After each conversation, point out my 3 most noticeable pronunciation issues.  
  > Explain them in Chinese and show the IPA where helpful.

### 2.3 High-frequency speaking patterns + substitution drills

- Ask AI for common patterns and drill them with substitutions.
- Prompt:

  > Give me 10 common workplace sentence patterns (e.g., disagreeing politely, making suggestions, giving status updates).  
  > For each pattern, provide 3 substitution examples and leave blanks for me to fill.  
  > Then grade my answers.

## 3) Listening: Customize Difficulty + Do Real Intensive Practice

### 3.1 Generate listening materials at your level

> Create a ~2-minute English monologue at CEFR B1 level on “pros and cons of remote work”.  
> Provide the transcript and 5 comprehension questions.  
> Make it slightly above my current level.

### 3.2 Intensive listening / dictation

Ask AI to “hide” the transcript and reveal it only when needed.

> I want to do intensive listening with this material.  
> Please give me the audio (or English text without Chinese translation). I will do dictation chunk by chunk.  
> After I send my attempt for a chunk, compare it to the original, mark errors, and suggest fixes.

### 3.3 Shadowing and imitation

> Split this text into natural chunks. Each sentence should be under 12 words. Number them.  
> I will shadow each line by number. Help me fix stress and linking.

## 4) Reading: Use AI as a Guide, Not a Replacement

The easiest mistake is: you don’t understand something, so you ask AI to translate the whole article—and you stop thinking.

A better approach is to use AI as a commentator and a question-asker.

### 4.1 Help with difficult articles

> This article is difficult for me. For each paragraph, do these 3 things:  
> 1) summarize the main idea in simple English;  
> 2) highlight 5–10 useful expressions and explain them;  
> 3) ask me 2 comprehension questions to check if I really understood.

### 4.2 Deep reading of academic/technical writing

Ask AI to rewrite into an “easier version” and compare it with the original.

> Rewrite this academic English into a version suitable for upper-intermediate learners: shorter sentences, clearer structure, but keep key technical terms.  
> After rewriting, explain what major simplifications you made.

### 4.3 Let AI question you (to force active thinking)

> I will try to retell this section in English. After I finish, tell me what I missed or misunderstood.  
> Give me a score from 0–10 and tell me how to improve.

---

## 5) Writing: Use AI as a Writing Coach

### 5.1 Correct and upgrade your writing (in two steps)

> Here is my English paragraph. Please do 3 things:  
> 1) only mark errors and give suggestions—don’t rewrite the whole thing yet;  
> 2) explain 3–5 recurring mistakes I tend to make;  
> 3) after I revise based on your suggestions, provide an “advanced version” for comparison.

### 5.2 Exam writing (IELTS/TOEFL/CET)

> Grade my essay using IELTS Writing Task 2 criteria.  
> Provide scores and actionable feedback for: Task Response, Coherence & Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammar Range & Accuracy.

### 5.3 Emails and reports

> I’ll give you the main points of a Chinese email. First write a natural, polite English version for communicating with US/EU coworkers.  
> Then provide a more concise, direct version for fast work communication.

---

## 6) Vocabulary & Grammar: Move From “Lookup” to “Compare + Produce”

Looking up definitions is fine, but “ask once, forget immediately” has low payoff. Try: compare → make sentences → review.

### 6.1 Compare similar words / grammar points

> Explain the differences between explain / illustrate / demonstrate in Chinese.  
> For each word, give 3 common collocations and 3 natural example sentences.  
> Then give me 5 fill-in-the-blank sentences to complete, and grade my answers.

### 6.2 A personalized mini grammar lesson based on your errors

> Based on the mistakes you found in my writing, design a 20-minute micro grammar lesson.  
> Teach only 1–2 points I keep getting wrong, with exercises and explanations.

### 6.3 Memory and spaced review

> Keep a list of words/phrases I mark as “not familiar” in our chat.  
> Every 3 days, quiz me using those items. Keep each quiz under 10 minutes.

---

## 7) Exams & Workplace: High-Fidelity Simulation

### 7.1 Speaking exams / interview simulation

IELTS speaking:

> Act as an IELTS speaking examiner. Test me using Part 1 / Part 2 / Part 3 structure.  
> Ask one question at a time. After I answer with voice, give feedback on fluency, grammar, and vocabulary, and estimate a band score.

Job interview:

> Act as an interviewer for a US/EU internet company and conduct a 30-minute interview in English.  
> Ask 5 common questions based on the JD, then follow up based on my resume.  
> After each round, point out 3 things I can improve (in Chinese).

### 7.2 Meetings, presentations, emails

> Next week I need a 10-minute English presentation in a weekly team meeting about project progress.  
> Based on my bullet points, write a conversational script.  
> Also list 10 likely questions and provide strong sample answers.

## 8) Tips When Using AI

1. **Don’t treat AI as “the answer key”**  
   Use it as a discussion partner. For controversial points, ask for multiple examples and verify with reputable dictionaries/corpora.

2. **Write prompts in English (or bilingual)**  
   You’ll get more natural output, and you’ll also practice reading English instructions.

3. **Ask AI to ask you questions**  
   Avoid “one big perfect answer”. Train one small goal at a time through interaction.

4. **Privacy and boundaries**  
   Don’t paste sensitive personal data or confidential work info. If you must share real text, anonymize it.

AI isn’t a shortcut. It’s a “language buddy” that can practice with you, explain things, and give feedback 24/7.

The real key is not how powerful the tool is—it’s whether you can use it actively and consistently, and make it part of your daily input and output.
