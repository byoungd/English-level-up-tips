# Speaking

Source (中文): [口语篇](#/threads/part-1/5-speaking.md)

Speaking is where everything comes together. And yes—pronunciation matters, but you don’t need to obsess. You just need a solid base and a lot of reps.

## IPA / Phonics

If you want to speak better, start with pronunciation. And to learn pronunciation, you’ll eventually meet IPA (phonetic symbols) or phonics.

There’s no shortcut here. The good news is: the content is limited. Learn the sounds, practice out loud, and come back to them repeatedly.

## Speak Out Loud

Speaking quietly and speaking out loud are very different.

Using *New Concept English* Book 3/4 as an example:

1. listen carefully first
2. read out loud
3. at the beginning, don’t worry about linking or pausing—just focus on clear, accurate sounds
4. once you can read smoothly, start mimicking the speaker’s rhythm and intonation

## Real Conversations: The “Yeah… yeah… yeah” Phase

When you first try to communicate in pure English, it’s common to feel this awkward gap:

In your head you want to say:

“I can’t believe we think the same way.”

But what comes out is just:

“Yeah.”

And then:

“Yeah… yeah… yeah…”

This is normal.

Many people speak like this at first:

1) think in Chinese  
2) translate into English in their head  
3) search for the right word  
4) get stuck and freeze

After enough listening and speaking practice, your brain starts building “reflex phrases”. In certain situations you’ll respond instantly without translating.

(The simplest proof is that people can blurt out things like “f**k” and “sh*t” without any effort.)

## Sing English Songs

If you’re already in love with melodies, why not sing?

Lately I’ve been into Troye Sivan. Here’s a simple way to practice:

- organize the lyrics
- write down unknown words and learn them first
- sing along (yes, I actually bought a microphone)

Clear motivation + strong goal + real interest = surprisingly good results.

## Prepare Common Questions for Yourself

To build “English intuition”, prepare a set of common topics and practice them repeatedly until you can speak smoothly and reorder sentences freely:

- introduce yourself
- introduce your hometown
- how life has been recently
- a few things that make you happiest
- a small but unforgettable memory
- your opinion on a product (e.g., iPad Pro)
